A third post describes a couple of useful perl utilities:

It is licensed under GPL v3. The text of that license is included in the file license.txt.

Note that currently, several ANNIE jape files that are part of the GATE distribution are included. They are copyrighted and licensed separately than the files developed for NAG.

These files are included to provide a complete set of baseline jape files needed for NAG to function.

To get started:
1. Install GATE
2. Copy this project to your machine.
3. Run the GATE Developer GUI
4. Create a New Processing Resource (Type: Jape Transducer, Name:NAG) pointing to main.jape in whatever directory you put the project files
5. Create a New Processing Resource (Type: Gazetteer, Name: Your Gazetteer) pointing to lists.def in whatever directory you put the project files
6. Create a language resource (either a corpus or single document).
7. Create an application. You need:
	Document Reset
	ANNIE_English_Tokeniser
	ANNIE_Sentence_Splitter
	ANNIE_POS_Tagger
